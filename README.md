# IoT-Based Water Quality Monitoring System for Aquaculture Ponds

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an IoT-based system for monitoring water quality in aquaculture ponds.
Water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, turbidity, ammonia, and nitrate
are analyzed to detect unsafe conditions early.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Ponds Water Quality Data
- File: Ponds.csv
- Records: 74,759
- Location: Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India

## Technologies Used
- IoT Sensors (pH, DO, Temperature, Turbidity, etc.)
- Arduino & ESP8266 (conceptual)
- MQTT / HTTP (conceptual communication)
- Python (data analysis)
- DataLab / Plotly (dashboard visualization)

## Files in This Repository
- `Ponds.csv` – Dataset
- `water_quality_analysis.ipynb` – Python analysis and visualizations
- `IoT_Water_Quality_Report.pdf` – Final project report

## Dashboard
The stored data is analyzed and visualized using DataLab dashboards to show trends and water quality status.
